# karn-keyboard
Custom, low profile, split, ortholinear, wireless, 38 key keyboard

What makes the Karn unique is the 1.5u thumb arc keys.

I didn't like "tucking" my thumb under my palm, and most other keyboards I found in this "Ferris" family of split, minimal keyboards have thumb keys located "inside" of the homing fj keys. 

The Karn aligns the inner thumb key with the homing column. This feels comfortable to me, and provides a sense of "homing" to my thumbs as well. With the additional thumb keys splaying out from there, in a more aggresive downward arc than the Ferris. This arc follows the natural arc of my thumb. I took photos and did measurements. You can see these in the development directory. 

Also, the thumb keys are designed for vertical 1.5u keycaps. This is because I found 1u keycaps uncomfortable for my thumbs, as I typically make contact with the side of my thumb, which has more surface area making contact, and the sharp edge of 1u keycaps would dig into the center of the area of skin making contact. 
Other keyboards are designed with maybe one or two larger thumb keys, but they are typically 2u, which means the added complexity of stabilizers, in addition to just feeling too big.
